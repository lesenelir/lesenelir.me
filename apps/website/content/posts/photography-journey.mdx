Photography has been one of my greatest passions, and I wanted to share some of the lessons I've learned along the way.

## How It Started

I got my first camera in 2020, during the pandemic. With more time at home, I started experimenting with different subjects:

- **Landscapes**: Captured the beauty of nature during weekend trips
- **Street Photography**: Documented everyday life in the city
- **Portraits**: Learned to work with people and capture emotions

## Key Lessons

### 1. Composition Matters More Than Gear

You don't need expensive equipment to take great photos. Understanding the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing can make a huge difference.

### 2. Light is Everything

The golden hour (just after sunrise or before sunset) provides the most beautiful, soft light for photography.

### 3. Practice Consistently

Like any skill, photography improves with practice. I try to take photos every day, even if it's just with my phone.

## Current Setup

- **Camera**: Sony A7 III
- **Lenses**: 24-70mm f/2.8, 85mm f/1.8
- **Editing**: Adobe Lightroom

Photography has taught me to see the world differently and appreciate the beauty in everyday moments.
